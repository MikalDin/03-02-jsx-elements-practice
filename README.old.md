# JSX Elements Practice

## Objective
Understand and practice creating basic JSX elements in React.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Locate the `App.js` file in the `src` folder.

## Tasks
1. Replace the existing code in `App.js` with a simple JSX element: a `<div>` containing an `<h1>` tag that says "Hello, World!".
2. Create a variable named `name` and assign your name to it. Use this variable inside an `<h1>` tag to display a personalized greeting.
3. Create a function `formatName(user)` that takes a user object and returns the user's full name. Use this function in your JSX to display a name.
4. Add a `<div>` containing two `<h2>` tags saying "Part 1" and "Part 2".
5. Use an `<img>` tag to display an image. The `src` of the image should be a URL of your choice.

## Bonus
Add a button with an `onClick` event that logs "Button clicked" to the console.

## Submission
Commit and push your changes to this repository. Make sure your final `App.js` file demonstrates the use of the JSX concepts covered.
